![screenshot](https://github.com/0ctopode/macDotfiles/blob/main/img/macDotfiles.png)
Not as extensive as my linux dots. Uses iTerm2 with nord theme, currently don't have a neovim theme because the nord looks pretty good.

**Some notable packages (via homebrew):**
* Relationship with spacemacs ended, am now neovim chad
* starship: spicy prompt
